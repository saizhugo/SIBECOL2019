CALL for WORKSHOP PROPOSALS 

Please fill in all the fields requested and return to info@congresosociedadibericaecologia2019.net before June 4th, 2018
Workshop will be scheduled on Monday, 4th of February 2019. Time allocated to each workshop may vary between 1.5 and 4 hours.

•	Title of the workshop*: EcoDataton - collaborative analysis of ecological data
     

•	Summary* (100-250 words): Datatons are data analysis meetings where people cooperate to solve questions of interest by using different datasets. The aim of these meetings is to enhance collaboration between the participants and to develop innnovative solutions to scientific problems. From the Ecoinformatics working group from AEET, this year we propose for the first time to carry out a Dataton based on Ecological questions. The participants will meet for a day to discuss and develop innovative ways to fill current gaps in ecological theory by using datasets provided by the organizers. Participants will get an introduction about the datasets and the questions to be answered, will organize in working groups to cooperatively solve these questions, and will meet for a final discussion to present and evaluate the different approaches developed during the event. During the meeting, participants will learn different methodologies to solve problems, establish collaborative bounds with other ecologists and plant the first seeds for future scientific collaborations. Due to the specific collaborative and practical nature of the event, EcoDataton will take place on 3rd of February, from 10 a.m. to 18 p.m.        
 (Should make clear what knowledge, skills, tools, or insights, participants might expect to gain from the course, must be open to all meeting attendees)
